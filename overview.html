		<p class="small">In RDR2, there are two game modes: Story and Online. I will be focusing
		on the story in this overview.</p>
		<br><br><br><br>

		Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game which follows the story of a man named Arthur Morgan. He is a cowboy who is part of a gang known to the general public as
		"Dutch's Boys" after the leader, Dutch Van Der Linde. Arthur describes Dutch as a father-figure to him, as he practically raised him from birth. The gang has
		around 15 members, and (most of them) are very close to eachother and are able to work as a team while doing various things, such as robbing trains, stealing from
		stores, and other criminal behavior.

		The game starts you out in the far north at a town called Colter after narrowly escaping the law. The weather is only getting more intense, so Dutch gets his gang to set up
		a temporary camp for a few days to wait for the weather to calm down. Low on food, they must rely on the weather calming down quickly so they can escape the
		icy wasteland and get back to society. After a few days and a couple robberies and raids on rivals, the weather calms down and they can start heading south
		to where they can properly survive.
		Unfortunately for them the gang is well known, and nearly every member has a large bounty on their heads, so they must
		stay in hiding unless they have a need to go into town, and even then, bounty hunters roam around towns and will recognize the player if they are close enough,
		and will try to arrest you or shoot you dead.

		Aside from progressing with Dutch's boys, there are plenty of other things to do by yourself. While travelling, you will frequently encounter random strangers,
		which you can interact with in various ways. Usually you will run into random civilians who are riding a horse or a carriage down the road. If you meet any
		of these, you can interact with them in either a positive or negative way. If you point your gun at someone, you can rob them and get money from them. There
		are also "special" strangers you can meet which will give you a mission to do, ask for help, try to kill you, and more. There's no shortage of things to do
		in the wild west, and this game really shows it.

		Another core feature of Red Dead Redemption 2 is the realism the creators have introduced to it. They have included things such as naturally growing hair, so if you play for a while, your
		hair and beard will grow over time. Other similar games don't do this, because hair is static (Unchanging) and it will never change unless you go to a barber and get it changed. But believe it or not, barbers in Red Dead (And real life!) cannot instantly triple the length of your hair, and
		you must wait for it to grow out. Another realism feature is the crime system. If you commit a crime, a bounty will be placed on your head and police will be dispatched after you. Even if you escape, your crimes will be remembered. If you return to a town where you commited major crimes, you
		will see that the law is on high alert for you, and will put you under arrest if they so much as see you. Overall, realism is a major part of the game, and is one of the reasons it is so enjoyable.
