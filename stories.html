			<center><p style="font-size: 64px;">While playing Red Dead Redemption 2, I've had plenty of interesting stories. Here are some of my favorite.</p></center>
			
			<p style="margin-top: 20px;">The first time I played Red Dead, I joined my friend's lobby. I spawned about 10 minutes from the town of Saint Denis, so I got on my horse to ride there. After about 10 minutes I finally arrive in the saloon that all my friends are currently in.
			I got off my horse and slowly started approaching the bar. The second I walked in, I watched one of my good friends, Mario collapsed due to alcohol poisoning and promptly died.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 20px;"> My second story is between me and a bunch of friends. When we get board while playing Red Dead, we will start a massive free for all fight between all of us, and just repetitively shoot, punch, and beat eachother up for up to an hour straight. I don't know what it is,
			but something about beating the absolute everything out of your best friends in a video game is somehow very fun.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 20px;">One of my favorite things about Red Dead Redemption 2 is how nice the community is. In many similar online games such as GTA V, people will shoot you and be toxic. In Red Dead, meeting new players is always a great experience because almost nobody will be rude to you,
			and a lot of the time they will help you with whatever your current objective is. I have made quite a few friends just doing missions and talking to them after.</p>
